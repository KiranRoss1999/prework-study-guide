        <h4>GIT Key Words</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Git — a tool that allows developers and others to use version control</li>
            <li>GitHub — one of many web interfaces for using Git</li>
            <li>Organization (org) — a grouping mechanism allowing teams to collaborate across many projects at once</li>
            <li>Repository (repo) — a folder in which all files and their version histories are stored</li>
            <li>Branch — a version of the repo that allows work without affecting other branches. Repos may have many branches for different possible changes being tested or considered, along with a default branch that serves as the source of truth.</li>
            <li>Fork — a new repository that inherits from a parent “upstream” repo. It is used to suggest changes to an “upstream” public repo by someone who doesn’t have access to edit in the repo’s home org.</li>
            <li>Markdown (.md) — a way to write content that converts plain text to formatted text.</li>
            <li>Commit Changes — a saved record of a change made to a file within the repo.</li>
            <li>Pull Request (PR) — a request for changes made to a branch to be pulled into another branch. Allows multiple users to see, discuss and review work being suggested.</li>
            <li>Merge — after a pull request is approved, the commit will be pulled in (or merged) from one branch to another and then, deployed on the live site</li>
            <li>Issues — allow users to report issues or bugs and track progress of assigning the fix for the issues.</li>
            <li>Federalist — a platform that securely deploys a website from a GitHub repository in minutes and lets users preview proposed and published changes.</li>
            <li>Projects — allows you to use GitHub for project management and tracking a set of issues, either for a specific repo or an entire org</li>
            <li>Wiki — a section of a repo made for hosting documentation. Documentation may be in the repo’s README files instead.</li>
            
        <h4>Bash Functions</h4>

            <li> pwd - displays the current working directory</li>
            <li>ls - displays the list of files and folders in the current directory</li>
            <li>cd - navigates between directories in the path</li>

            <li>mkdir - creates a new directory</li>
            <li>touch - creastes a file inside a directory</li>
